# Number-guessing-game
+ Introduction of Class-based Structure:

  The upgraded version introduces a class-based structure to manage the game's logic and data more systematically. This improves the code's readability and maintainability.
+ Code Modularization:

  In the upgraded version, functions related to the game logic are encapsulated within classes for modularization. This increases code reusability and makes it easier to modify or add features.
+ Improvement in Restart Functionality:

  The upgraded version implements the game restart functionality more efficiently. Previously, restarting required resetting all results, but now, with the use of a class-based structure, a method specifically for resetting the game state is implemented, making the restart process simpler.
+ Additional Notification upon Game End:

  The upgraded version includes a feature to display the correct answer when the game ends. This helps users understand why they failed when the game concludes.
+ Enhancement in Input Value Validation:

  In the upgraded version, the method for validating input values is improved. If a non-numeric value is entered, a feature is added to redirect the user back to the game screen, enhancing user experience.
